# VulDeeLocator: A Deep Learning-based System for Detecting and Locating Software Vulnerabilities
 
 
VulDeeLocator, a Vulnerability Deep learning-based Detector and Locator system, is the first deep learning-based vulnerability detection system that can also pin down the precise locations of vulnerabilities. One key insight is to leverage both the source code and the intermediate code to accommodate the semantic information useful for detecting and locating vulnerabilities. We extract pieces of source code according to some syntax information (i.e., source code- and Syntax-based Vulnerability Candidate or sSyVC), involving four kinds of sSyVCs: library/API function call (FC), array definition (AD), pointer definition (PD), and arithmetic expression (AE). Then extend these pieces of code to accommodate some semantic information from the intermediate code (i.e., intermediate code- and Semantics-based Vulnerability Candidate or iSeVC).
 
We prepare a dataset of Lower Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) intermediate code, containing 77 CWE IDs (i.e., types of vulnerabilities) from two data sources: the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and the Software Assurance Reference Dataset (SARD). The resulting dataset contains 88,447 iSeVCs, among which 24,041 are vulnerable and 64,406 are not vulnerable. For vulnerable iSeVCs, the line numbers of the vulnerabilities are available.
